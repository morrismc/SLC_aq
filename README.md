# Salt Lake City Air quality
This script was written to explore the potential for there to be significant air quality affects from the early 2020 covid lockdowns.

There was a distinctive period in the spring of 2020 when Salt Lake City experienced very little vehicular traffic, which is known as the number one contributor to the valley's inversions. I wanted to conduct a simple visual data visualization to see whether or not there were significant effects from this lockdown period
